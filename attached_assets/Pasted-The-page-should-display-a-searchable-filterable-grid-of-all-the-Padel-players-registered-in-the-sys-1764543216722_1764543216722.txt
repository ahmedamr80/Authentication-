The page should display a searchable, filterable grid of all the Padel players registered in the system.

🧩 How it Works (The Logic Flow)
This page acts like a funnel. It takes everyone in the database and refines the list based on what the user is looking for.
1. The "Resilient" Fetcher (Loading Data)
The code for getting members should be very smart. It doesn't just try once; it has a Fallback Strategy (a Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C) to ensure it finds data even if the database is messy.
•	Attempt 1 (The Specifics): Tries to find users marked specifically as "active players."
•	Attempt 2 (The Broad Search): If that fails, it looks for anyone with the role "player."
•	Attempt 3 (The Safety Net): If that fails, it grabs everyone and filters them manually in the code.
2. The "Smart" Filter Engine
Once the data is downloaded, the page should use a powerful tool called useMemo. This allows the app to filter and sort hundreds of users instantly without slowing down the phone/computer.
It listens to two things:
1.	The Search Bar: Matches names, nicknames, or locations.
2.	The Filter Menu: Checks specific traits like Skill Level, Hand (Left/Right), Position, or Gender.
3. The Sorting Hat
Users can organize the list how they want. The code should handles this with a specific switch logic:
•	By Skill: It converts "Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/expert" into numbers (1, 2, 3,4) so it can rank them mathematically.
•	By Date: It compares timestamps to see who joined most recently.

🔍 Visual Breakdown of the Screen
A. The Control Center (Top)
•	Breadcrumbs: Shows the user where they are (e.g., Home > Community).
•	Advanced Filter: A complex component that builds dropdowns for Skill, Hand, etc., based on the filterConfig list.
•	Sort Bar: A dropdown to toggle between sorting by Name, Skill, or Location.
B. The Member Grid (Main Content)
•	The code loops through the filteredAndSortedMembers list and creates a card for each person.
•	The Avatar: It tries to show the user's photo. If the photo breaks or doesn't exist, it falls back to showing their First Initial on a colorful background.
•	The Badges: It automatically colors the skill badge:
o	Beginner $\rightarrow$ Green
o	Intermediate $\rightarrow$ Yellow
o	Advanced $\rightarrow$ Red.
C. The "No Results" State
If the user filters too strictly (e.g., "Left-handed Beginners in Antarctica"), the code detects the empty list and shows a friendly "No members found" message with a button to clear filters.

💡 Key Code Concepts
1. Optimization with useMemo
This block ensures the app doesn't re-calculate the whole list every time the user blinks. It only re-runs the logic if the members list, filters, or sortBy settings change.
TypeScript
const filteredAndSortedMembers = useMemo(() => {
    // 1. Filter the list
    let filtered = applyFilters(...);
    // 2. Sort the list
    filtered.sort((a, b) => { ... });
    return filtered;
}, [members, filters, ...]);
2. Dynamic Date Filtering
This section should allow users to find members who joined in a specific month (e.g., "Who joined in January?"). It extracts the month from the user's createdAt timestamp.
TypeScript
if (filters.registrationMonth) {
  const month = parseInt(filters.registrationMonth);
  filtered = filtered.filter(member => {
    // Check if the user's creation month matches the selected filter
    return date.getMonth() === month;
  });
}
🚀 Next Step
1.	Add Pagination: If you get 1,000 members, loading them all at once might be slow. We can add "Load More" functionality.
